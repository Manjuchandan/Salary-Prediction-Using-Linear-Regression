# Salary-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
With Simple Linear Regression, we have to do 5 steps as per below:
1. Importing the dataset.
2. Splitting dataset into training set and testing set (2 dimensions of X and y per each set). Normally, the testing set should be 5% to 30% of dataset.
3. Visualize the training set and testing set to double check (you can bypass this step if you want).
4. Initializing the regression model and fitting it using training set (both X and y).
5. Letâ€™s predict!!
